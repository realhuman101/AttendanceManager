## Introduction

Manage attendance at any event with this simple and easy-to-use application. This project is designed to help you keep track of who is present at your event, and who is not.

This project is built with React, Typescript and Tailwind CSS ([Frontend](/Client)) with C# ([Backend](/Server)). I also used MSSQL, however you can use any RDBMS you want by installing the corresponding [Entity Framework Nuget package](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/providers/?tabs=dotnet-core-cli).
